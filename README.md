# Vue3 Firebase Project
Here I have several components which are rendered by the routes. We can browse through each router without reloading the page, with smooth transition effect. 
Reusable form validation is also implemented using composables function.
This project also has built in User Authentication using Firebase API. User information data is saved in our Firebase database. With Google Oauth, users can also sign-in with their Google accounts safely.
Update: April 28, I have added a Create router page, which allows registered users to create and delete their own products by calling The Fetch API(POST and DELETE request). 
Update: May 14. I have removed Fetch API and used Firestore to store real-time data.
